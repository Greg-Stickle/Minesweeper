- A square indicates any of the units in the game of minesweeper
that contains either a number, a blank("0") or a mine.
- A game is won at the point when all squares that are not mines are
clicked open
- A game is lost when a square that a player clicks open contains a
mine
- A board is pregenerated
- The first square clicked never contains a mine
	> If it did contain a mine, the mine is moved to the top left
	until it is placed in an empty square.
- The square the cursor is over at the point of release of the lmb
is the square that is opened.
- A number represents the number of mines that exist in the eight
squares touching the square that was opened
	> If the square is a zero, all squares touching that square
	are also opened.
- Right clicking causes a flag to appear. Right clicking again removes
the flag.
- Chording. Double clicking on a number opens up the remaining squares
that are not flagged. 
- The number of mines in a board are predetermined
	> 10 mines in an 8x8
	> 40 mines in an 16x16
	> 99 mines in an 16x30
